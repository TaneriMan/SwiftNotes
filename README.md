# Great App Design
The difference between UX and UI:
UX (User Experience) -> flow, work and feelings your app
UI (User Interface)-> color,design and look your app

UX has 2 layers
1) Everything must work. Test is very important
2) App invoks feeling a feeling or sensation of use

Questions
1) What is users' need
2) What you think wows them
We should maintain a balance between them.

UI
The color is important for your app. Look at color emotions. Look at Adobe color wheel, Digital Telephaty and Color Lovers. Moreover, there is an article about colors http://v.ht/lad-color Colors are important for app.
